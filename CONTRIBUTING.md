For your Git Commit Messages, please orientate on the guidance in the following [article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

> The seven rules of a great Git Commit Message

> - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
> - Capitalize the subject line
> - Do not end the subject line with a period
> - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> - Wrap the body at 72 characters
> - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Pull Requests

Every new feature must be developed on a feature branch and merged into master. **Please do not push directly to master!** We also provide a [Pull Request Template](/.github/pull_request_template.md) for additional guidance. In any case, the Pull Request has to be reviewed and approved by one other developer before merging.

## Branching

Next to `feature/<feature-name>` and `fix/<bug-name>` branches, we also have a `master` and `production` branches. `master` is our development branch were new code is merged into first - every release will be merged into `production`.
